	<H3>How to report bugs</H3>
	<P>
	If you find something is not running as you expected and think it's a bug, please
	follow the following procedure.
	</P>
	<P>
	The PMD Plugin has a logging facility based on Log4J. The first thing is
	to switch the trace level to DEBUG : Go to Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; PMD and
	configure the "Logging options". Also verify the logfile location. Delete then the
	logfile first (probably a file called pmd-eclipse.log) to throw away old
	informations.
	</P>
	<P>
	Restart Eclipse and try to reproduce the problems. Zip the log file and report the
	bug on <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pmd">sourceforge</A> (you need to
	be logged in order to submit a bug).
	Don't forget to select as module "Eclipse". Attach the
	zipped log file to the request.
	</P>
	<P>Thanks for your help !</P>
